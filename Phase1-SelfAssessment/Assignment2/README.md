I led Copilot do the tedious work of filling the list of cars with viable makers, models and other attributes.

For saving the filtered Ccars to files, a PrintWriter was initiated. 
Following that, is was just a case of setting a filter value and looping through all cars to compare their attributes to that filter values.
